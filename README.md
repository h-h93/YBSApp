# YBSApp
YBS take home test

Welcome to YBSApp! This project is a modern image browsing application built using Swift. The app allows users to search for and display images from Flickr based on user input, providing a seamless and intuitive browsing experience. Below are the key features and architectural choices that make this app unique.

Features

MVC Architecture: The app is structured using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code.

Async/Await: Utilises Swift's async/await syntax for efficient and readable asynchronous code execution, enhancing performance and responsiveness.

Compositional Layouts: The search screen employs compositional layouts to handle a vast array of images, ensuring a dynamic and visually appealing user interface.

Flow Grid Layout: Displays user images in a flow grid layout, providing a structured yet flexible image presentation.

Header View for Image Details: When a user taps on an image, a header view appears showing the profile picture, username, and profile description of the image owner. This view is interactive; clicking on the profile image, username, or description navigates to the user's profile, much like Instagram.

Detailed Image Information: Image details are displayed in a UITableView, allowing users to easily access the information they need.

Search Bar Functionality: Includes a search bar that performs searches on Flickr for images based on user input, supporting both keyword and tag-based searches.
